hi there my name is Jinay Desai, an aspiring software engineer in Ontario👋

I am currently a junior at Turner Fenton SS, in the IB program.🧠 

In the past year, I have been able to build various projects and get into AI and web development. 

my recent projects include💡:

Projected to reduce household fruit waste by 90% in the average Canadian household. built with: cloud vision API, SQL, Flask, Javascript, HTML/CSS
- hopelink🔗: A helpful tool in apocalyptic situations that links regions through a resource network. Uses real-time location to pin-point sources of food, water and other wanted resources. Working toward implementing an offline mesh network. built with React, HTML, CSS, Flask, Python

Next Steps⏩:
- Working on completing a Harvard course in AI
